APES Ecocolumn: 

This is my AP Environmental Science Ecocolumn Project Lab Report. As a group of 4, we made a physical model of an ecosystem consisting of 3 bottles with 3 layers: terrestrial, decomposition, and aquatic layer. Individually, we took measurements of the different nutrients/conditions of each chamber and wanted to find the interconnections between these nutrients. I probably spent an upward of 60-70 hours just formatting graphs, writing meaningful reasoning, and improving captions/images. Not only did this teach me time management while managing 6 other classes, but it also provided an excellent experience in research. We weren’t just trying to figure out what was happening in the Ecocolumn, but how does this show what happens in a regular ecosystem. My general question was “How does organism death affect an ecosystem” – and I needed to do countless research and filtering of sources, to find relevant info and compose it into a lab report. Overall, the time that I spent on this project was extremely valuable, teaching me skills that I will definitely need for researching other topics. Attached is a PDF of the report. -Jai
