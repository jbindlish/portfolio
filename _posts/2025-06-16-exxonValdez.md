Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Project:
Attached below is my AP Biology final project. We were tasked with finding a human impact to the environment, researching it, and providing a solution plan. It was presented throughout the final days of the school year, in front of the class. It was really interesting to analyze an oil spill beyond "It hurt animals" and actually dive deep into the long term and short term effects. I also practiced researching by compiling and analyzing relialbe sources, then actually proposing my own solution. For the video associated with this project, contact me at my email.
