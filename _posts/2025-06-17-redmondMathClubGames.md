I’m excited to share that we’ve successfully completed our very FIRST 6-week, in-person Math Club at my local Library (Redmond) on June 17! It was really cool to help shape and lead the curriculum for students with Ms. Alana and see the growth in students every single week. 

Here is the session description – taken from the official [Redmond KCLS Website](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/6813b654d41c64603169dbf2)

The program entails having different lessons every week, with different activities for every grade range from K-1, 2-3, and 4-5. I volunteered across the grade ranges – sometimes helping kindergarteners count on their fingers or 7th graders with their Algebra homework. 

Session activities are detailed below. 

May 13: Paper Airplanes
May 20 Math Board Games
May 27: Sudoku
June 3: Tangrams & Fractals
June 10: Origami
June 17: Logic Puzzles

During these sessions, I shared my thoughts with Ms. Alana to increase engagement. One such example was a reward system in every session. During the first ever session, when kids were building and testing how far their airplane flew, I felt that an incentive was needed to keep the kids engaged and encourage them to try out different planes. So, Ms. Alana and I started giving out official KCLS Redmond Library branded pencils to students if they met a certain threshold of length. We also documented who went the furthest for extra prizes.

Another example of suggested feedback (that didn’t get changed immediately but in adapted in other sessions) was that some activities were either too easy or too hard – changes that were relayed to the main math club advisor and passed to other locations. 


The sessions averaged around 25-30 students every week, which is an awesome turnout! It was a very fun experience, where students learnt about math in a low-pressure, drop-in environment. I appreciate Ms. Alana’s leadership and her receptiveness to my feedback for the program. I’m glad I could make a change in the curriculum to improve the experiences of the 30+ kids we helped every week, hopefully soon expanding across locations.

Here are some fun pictures from my experience!
