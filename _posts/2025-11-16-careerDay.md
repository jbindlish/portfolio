Career Day was amazing! Generous presenters gave valuable insights to students at Tesla STEM High School on 11/12. Students learned about Aerospace Engineering, Video Game Development, Financial Analysis, AI Engineering, and much much more. Attached are some pictures from the open event.

Organizing this event was certainly a rewarding experience. I cold called parents and previous presenters, established venue availability and timing, and organized chaperoning and group-assignments. Overall, I’ve learned a lot of event planning and networking.
